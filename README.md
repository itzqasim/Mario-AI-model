                     Mario AI Model 
                         with
              Proximal Policy Optimization

                                                                                           
The project is developing and training an AI model using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to master the iconic video game, 
Super Mario. The report begins by explaining the PPO algorithm's core principles and its suitability for training AI agents in complex environments.
It describes the methodology used to collect and preprocess game data and create a custom reinforcement learning environment tailored to Super Mario. 
The AI agent is constructed using deep reinforcement learning techniques, which combine neural networks and PPO to optimize its policy.

The training process is explored, focusing on challenges like the exploration-exploitation trade-off and implementing reward shaping to facilitate learning. 
The report includes the fine-tuning of hyperparameters and presents performance metrics, learning curves, and comparisons to baseline models, showcasing the agent's progress and proficiency.
